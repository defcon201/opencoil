# Charging Pad 3d Model

Positive mold for thermo (vacuum) forming replica charging pads. *Note: the model is not tapered to ease mold release. This will make it harder to remove the mould but ensure a snug fitting end result. Depending on type of plastics used for mold and counter mold, 3d print this model at 101-102% size to account for shrinkage.*
